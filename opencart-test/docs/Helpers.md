Helpers are stateless PHP functions. In OpenCart they are used to fix some short comings of some PHP built in functions. For example the function [strtolower](http://php.net/manual/en/function.strtolower.php) can not handle many foreign characters and the UTF-8 functions that do are only installed on later version of PHP.
